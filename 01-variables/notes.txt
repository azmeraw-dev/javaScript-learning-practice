📘 JavaScript Notes — Variables

📂 Topic: Variables in JavaScript

✅ Concept Summary:
Variables are containers used to store data values in JavaScript. They allow us to reuse and manipulate data in programs.

💡 Key Points:
- Use **let** for variables that can be reassigned.
- Use **const** for values that should not change.
- **var** is the old way of declaring variables — avoid it in modern JavaScript.
- Variable names must start with a letter, $, or _ and cannot start with a number.
- JavaScript is **case-sensitive** (`myName` ≠ `myname`).

🧠 Examples:
let firstName = "Azmeraw";
const country = "Ethiopia";
let age = 25;

console.log(`My name is ${firstName}, I live in ${country}, and I am ${age} years old.`);
